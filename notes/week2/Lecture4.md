# Lecture 4: Gradient Descent for Multiple Linear Regression with Vectorization

#### Recap and Transition
- The video combines key concepts of **gradient descent**, **multiple linear regression**, and **vectorization**.
- It transitions from univariate linear regression to **multiple linear regression** using **vector notation** for cleaner and more efficient computation.

---

#### Multiple Linear Regression in Vector Notation
- **Parameters**: 
  - Instead of individual parameters \( w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n \), they are collected into a vector \( \mathbf{w} \) of length \( n \).
  - \( b \) (bias) remains a single scalar.
- **Model Representation**:  
  \( f_{\mathbf{w}, b}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b \)  
  where \( \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} \) represents the **dot product**.

---

#### Cost Function
- Defined as \( J(\mathbf{w}, b) \), where:
  - \( \mathbf{w} \) is the vector of weights.
  - \( b \) is the scalar bias.

---

#### Gradient Descent for Multiple Features
1. **Gradient Descent Update Rule**:
   - General formula:
     \( w_j = w_j - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial w_j} \)
     \( b = b - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial b} \)
     where \( \alpha \) is the **learning rate**.
   - Updates \( w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n \) and \( b \) iteratively.
  
2. **Difference Between Single and Multiple Features**:
   - With **one feature**:
     \( \frac{\partial J}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (f(x_i) - y_i) \cdot x_i \)
   - With **multiple features**:
     - Formula becomes:
       \( \frac{\partial J}{\partial w_j} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (f(\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i) \cdot x_{ij} \),
       for \( j = 1, 2, \dots, n \).
     - Each weight \( w_j \) corresponds to its respective feature.

---

#### Vectorized Gradient Descent
- Efficient implementation using vectorized operations:
  - Prediction: \( \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{w} + b \),
    where \( \mathbf{X} \) is the feature matrix.
  - Gradient updates are computed in parallel for all \( w_j \) using matrix-vector multiplication.

---

#### Alternative Method: Normal Equation
- An alternative to gradient descent for solving \( \mathbf{w} \) and \( b \):
  - Direct solution using advanced linear algebra.
  - Efficient for small datasets but:
    - **Not generalized** for algorithms like logistic regression or neural networks.
    - **Computationally expensive** for large datasets.
- Often used in **back-end libraries** for linear regression.

---

#### Key Insights
- **Gradient Descent**:
  - Iterative, scalable, and generalized for various machine learning algorithms.
  - Works well for large datasets with proper feature scaling and learning rate.
- **Normal Equation**:
  - Analytical solution for linear regression but limited scalability and flexibility.

---

#### Application in Labs
- The optional lab introduces:
  - **NumPy** implementation for vectorized multiple linear regression.
  - How to calculate predictions \( f(\mathbf{x}) \), cost \( J \), and gradient descent updates.
  - Emphasis on understanding **NumPy syntax** and **vectorized operations**.

---

#### Closing Notes
- Multiple linear regression is one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms.
- Upcoming videos cover techniques like:
  - Feature scaling.
  - Choosing optimal learning rates for better performance.
