## 📚 About the Course

I will be following the [Introduction to Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) on Coursera. This specialization offers foundational knowledge and hands-on skills to start a career in machine learning. Below are the course details:

| **Course**                                   | **Description**                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Supervised Machine Learning**            | Fundamentals of supervised ML, key algorithms, and hands-on implementation.                        |
| **Unsupervised Machine Learning**          | Clustering and dimensionality reduction for insightful data analysis.                              |
| **Deep Learning**                          | Introduction to neural networks and deep learning for advanced pattern recognition.                |

#### Additionally, I will be learning Python, along with other tools required for this course on the side. The repo for that can be found [*here*](https://github.com/rajin-khan/python-self).
