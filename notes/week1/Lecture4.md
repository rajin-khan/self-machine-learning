# Lecture 4: Supervised Learning and Its Applications

## Definition of Supervised Learning
Supervised learning refers to machine learning algorithms that learn input-to-output mappings (x to y). The defining characteristic is that these algorithms are trained on labeled examples, where the correct output (y) is provided for a given input (x). By learning from these labeled datasets, the algorithm can make predictions for new, unseen inputs.

### Key Features:
- Input (x) is paired with a desired output label (y).
- The algorithm learns from examples and improves its predictions over time.
- After training, it predicts the output (y) for a new input (x).

## Applications of Supervised Learning
### 1. **Spam Filtering:**
   - **Input (x):** Email text.
   - **Output (y):** Spam or not spam.

### 2. **Speech Recognition:**
   - **Input (x):** Audio clips.
   - **Output (y):** Text transcripts.

### 3. **Machine Translation:**
   - **Input (x):** Text in one language.
   - **Output (y):** Translated text in another language.

### 4. **Online Advertising:**
   - **Input (x):** Ad and user data.
   - **Output (y):** Click prediction.
   - **Economic Value:** This drives significant revenue for online platforms as every click generates income.

### 5. **Self-Driving Cars:**
   - **Input (x):** Images and sensor data (e.g., radar).
   - **Output (y):** Positions of other vehicles for safe navigation.

### 6. **Manufacturing (Visual Inspection):**
   - **Input (x):** Images of manufactured products.
   - **Output (y):** Detection of defects like scratches or dents.

## Example: Predicting Housing Prices
### Task:
Predict house prices based on the size of the house.

### Dataset:
- **X-axis:** Size of the house (e.g., square feet).
- **Y-axis:** Price of the house (e.g., in thousands of dollars).

### Process:
1. Plot the data points (house size vs. price).
2. Fit a function to the data:
   - **Straight Line:** Simplistic approach.
   - **Curved Function:** More complex but may fit the data better.
3. Make predictions for new data points (e.g., predicting the price for a 750-square-foot house).

### Insights:
- Choosing the appropriate function (line, curve, etc.) is crucial.
- This process demonstrates **supervised learning** as the algorithm learns from labeled examples (house size with correct prices).

## Types of Supervised Learning Problems
1. **Regression:**
   - Predicts continuous numerical values.
   - Example: Housing price prediction.
   - Possible outputs: $150,000, $70,000, $183,000, etc.

2. **Classification:**
   - Predicts discrete labels or categories.
   - Example: Spam or not spam (binary classification).

### Key Takeaways:
- Supervised learning involves learning input-output mappings using labeled datasets.
- Applications range from spam filtering and speech recognition to self-driving cars and defect detection in manufacturing.
- Regression and classification are two main types of supervised learning problems.

In the next lecture, we will explore classification problems in supervised learning and discuss their real-world applications.
