# Lecture 17: Gradient Descent in Action for Linear Regression  

**1. Gradient Descent Process**  
- The gradient descent algorithm is used to fit a linear regression model by minimizing the cost function.  
- Key visualizations include:  
  - **Upper Left:** A plot of the model and data.  
  - **Upper Right:** A contour plot of the cost function.  
  - **Bottom:** A surface plot of the cost function.  
- Example initialization:  
  - \( w = -0.1 \), \( b = 900 \), resulting in \( f(x) = -0.1x + 900 \).  
- Steps in gradient descent:  
  - At each step, \( w \) and \( b \) are updated, reducing the cost.  
  - The parameters \( w \) and \( b \) follow a trajectory towards the global minimum.  
  - The corresponding straight line fit improves iteratively, eventually achieving a good fit to the data.  

**2. Key Observations**  
- **Global Minimum:**  
  - Gradient descent aims to find the global minimum of the cost function, which has a bowl shape for linear regression (convex function).  
  - Convex functions ensure no local minima, guaranteeing convergence to the global minimum with an appropriate learning rate.  
- **Prediction Example:**  
  - Once trained, the model \( f(x) \) can make predictions, such as predicting the price of a house given its size.  

**3. Batch Gradient Descent**  
- **Definition:**  
  - In batch gradient descent, the entire training dataset is used to compute gradients at each update step.  
- **Terminology Origin:**  
  - The term "batch" refers to using the entire batch of training examples rather than subsets.  
- **Other Variants:**  
  - Alternative gradient descent methods use smaller subsets (mini-batches) of the training data for updates.
