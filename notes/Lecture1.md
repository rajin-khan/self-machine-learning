# Lecture 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a technology that allows computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It powers many tools and services we use daily, often without us realizing it.

### Everyday Applications of Machine Learning
| **Application**          | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Search Engines**       | Ranks web pages to provide relevant results for queries like "How to make sushi." |
| **Photo Tagging**        | Recognizes and labels friends in pictures on apps like Instagram or Snapchat.   |
| **Movie Recommendations**| Suggests movies you might like based on viewing history on streaming services.   |
| **Voice Assistants**     | Powers interactions like "Hey Siri, play Rihanna" or "Okay Google, find restaurants." |
| **Spam Detection**       | Flags suspicious emails, e.g., "Congratulations! You've won a million dollars." |

### Industrial and Enterprise Applications
Machine learning is transforming industries and addressing global challenges:
- **Climate Change**: Optimizing wind turbine power generation.
- **Healthcare**: Assisting doctors in making accurate diagnoses.
- **Manufacturing**: Using computer vision to inspect products for defects on assembly lines.

### Definition of Machine Learning
Machine learning is the science of getting computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It underpins many AI applications and continues to grow in influence.
