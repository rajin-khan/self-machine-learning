# Lecture 12: Introduction to Gradient Descent

---

**Recap:**
In the previous lecture, we explored visualizations of the cost function \( J(w, b) \) and observed how different values of parameters \( w \) and \( b \) yield varying cost values. While manual exploration is insightful, it lacks a systematic approach to finding the optimal \( w \) and \( b \). This leads us to the concept of **gradient descent**.

---

### **What is Gradient Descent?**
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the parameters \( w \) and \( b \) that minimize the cost function \( J(w, b) \). This algorithm is widely used in machine learning, not only for linear regression but also for training advanced neural network models, including deep learning models. Mastering gradient descent forms a critical foundation for understanding machine learning.

---

### **Overview of Gradient Descent:**
1. **Objective:** Minimize the cost function \( J(w, b) \) by iteratively adjusting the parameters \( w \) and \( b \).
2. **Applicability:** Gradient descent is a general algorithm that can minimize:
   - Cost functions for linear regression.
   - More complex functions with multiple parameters \( w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n \) and \( b \).
3. **Initialization:** Start with initial guesses for \( w \) and \( b \). Commonly, these values are set to zero.
4. **Algorithm:** Iteratively update \( w \) and \( b \) to reduce \( J(w, b) \) until convergence (i.e., when the cost stabilizes near a minimum).

---

### **Gradient Descent for Linear Regression:**
- The cost function for linear regression is typically a squared error function, which forms a bowl or hammock shape. This ensures the existence of a unique global minimum.
- Gradient descent is ideal for finding this global minimum efficiently.

### **Gradient Descent for General Functions:**
- For more complex functions (e.g., those used in neural networks), the surface of \( J(w, b) \) may contain multiple local minima.
- The algorithm adapts to these scenarios but may converge to different minima depending on the initialization.

---

### **Visualization and Intuition:**
1. Imagine a surface plot of \( J(w, b) \), where the height represents the cost function value. The goal is to "descend" to the lowest point (minimum cost).
2. **Hill Descent Analogy:**
   - Envision the surface as a hilly landscape.
   - Starting from an initial point, identify the direction of the steepest descentâ€”the direction that reduces cost most rapidly.
   - Take a small step in that direction (a "baby step").
   - Repeat the process until reaching a valley (minimum).

3. **Key Properties:**
   - Gradient descent finds the steepest descent direction at each step.
   - The algorithm converges to a minimum, which can be a local or global minimum, depending on the function.

---

### **Local and Global Minima:**
- A **local minimum** is a point where \( J(w, b) \) is smaller than at surrounding points but may not be the smallest value overall.
- A **global minimum** is the absolute smallest value of \( J(w, b) \) across the entire parameter space.

#### Example:
- If the cost function has multiple valleys:
  - Starting at different initial points can lead to convergence at different valleys.
  - Gradient descent will always descend to the nearest local minimum relative to the starting point.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- Gradient descent iteratively adjusts \( w \) and \( b \) to minimize \( J(w, b) \).
- Initialization impacts the final solution for functions with multiple local minima.
- For linear regression with a bowl-shaped cost function, gradient descent always converges to the global minimum.

In the next lecture, we will delve into the mathematical expressions underlying gradient descent and learn how to implement it computationally.
