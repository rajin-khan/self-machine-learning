# Lecture 3: What is Machine Learning?

## Definition of Machine Learning
Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This informal yet insightful definition highlights the essence of machine learning—enabling computers to improve their performance by learning from experience.

### Arthur Samuel's Checkers Program
- In the 1950s, Arthur Samuel developed a checkers-playing program.
- Despite not being an expert checkers player himself, Samuel designed the program to play tens of thousands of games against itself.
- Through these games, the program learned which board positions tended to lead to wins or losses.
- Over time, it became a better checkers player than Samuel himself by identifying and pursuing favorable board positions.

### Key Takeaway
The more opportunities a learning algorithm has to learn, the better its performance tends to be. However, practice questions and challenges along the way are valuable for reinforcing understanding of the underlying concepts.

## Major Types of Machine Learning Algorithms
Machine learning algorithms can be broadly categorized into two main types:

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Supervised learning is the most commonly used type of machine learning in real-world applications.
   - The focus is on learning from labeled data.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns in data without labeled outcomes.

### Additional Types
- **Recommender Systems**: Algorithms designed to suggest relevant items to users.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms that learn by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback.

### Course Focus
This specialization includes three courses:
- **Courses 1 & 2**: Focus on supervised learning.
- **Course 3**: Covers unsupervised learning, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning.

## Practical Advice for Applying Learning Algorithms
### Importance of Practical Skills
- Possessing a set of tools (machine learning algorithms) is essential, but knowing how to apply them effectively is equally, if not more, important.
- Practical advice is emphasized to help learners develop valuable machine learning systems.

### Challenges in Application
- Even experienced teams in top tech companies sometimes spend months using ineffective approaches to solve problems.
- This course aims to teach best practices to avoid such pitfalls and ensure the effective use of tools.

### Outcome
By the end of this course, learners will:
- Gain a deep understanding of how to design and build robust machine learning systems.
- Develop the skills needed to become proficient machine learning engineers capable of tackling real-world challenges.

## Looking Ahead
In the next video, we’ll explore:
- Supervised learning and unsupervised learning in greater detail.
- When and why to use each type of learning algorithm.

Let’s continue this exciting journey into machine learning!
