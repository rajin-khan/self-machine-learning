# Lecture 7: Overview of Unsupervised Learning and Other Algorithms

### Formal Definition of Unsupervised Learning
- In supervised learning, data includes both inputs \(x\) and labels \(y\).
- In unsupervised learning, data includes only inputs \(x\), with no labels \(y\).
- The algorithm’s task is to discover structure, patterns, or interesting features in the data.

### Types of Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning encompasses a variety of algorithms designed to derive insights from unlabeled data. Beyond clustering, this lecture introduces:

1. **Clustering**:
   - Groups similar data points together.
   - Example: Google News grouping similar articles based on shared keywords.

2. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Identifies unusual events or outliers in data.
   - Applications:
     - Fraud detection in financial systems.
     - Detecting unusual events in other domains.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Compresses large datasets into smaller datasets while retaining most of the information.
   - Enables efficient data storage and analysis without significant loss of insights.

These additional methods—anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction—are central to many practical applications and will be explored in greater detail later.

### Understanding through Examples
Below are some examples to help clarify the distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning:

- **Spam Filtering**:
  - Data is labeled as spam or non-spam.
  - This is a supervised learning problem.

- **Google News Clustering**:
  - Articles are grouped based on content similarities.
  - This employs a clustering algorithm and is an example of unsupervised learning.

- **Market Segmentation**:
  - Groups customers into distinct segments based on their data.
  - This is an unsupervised learning problem as it involves finding patterns without predefined labels.

- **Diabetes Diagnosis**:
  - Data is labeled with the presence or absence of diabetes.
  - This is analogous to the breast cancer classification problem and is a supervised learning problem.

### Key Insights
- Clustering is one of many unsupervised learning techniques.
- Anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction expand the scope of unsupervised learning beyond clustering.
- Each method has specific applications and benefits that make it valuable for different types of problems.

### Looking Ahead
The next section will dive deeper into anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction, as well as their respective applications and implementations.

### A Glimpse into Jupyter Notebooks
Before concluding this segment, we will explore the use of Jupyter Notebooks—a powerful tool for performing machine learning tasks. This will be the focus of the next lecture.
