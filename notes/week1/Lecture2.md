## Why is Machine Learning Widely Used?

Machine learning has grown as a sub-field of AI, enabling systems to perform tasks without explicit programming. Its flexibility addresses challenges in:

| **Application**                | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Web Search**                | Algorithms like Google Search rank web pages efficiently.                     |
| **Speech Recognition**        | Enables systems to interpret and process human speech.                        |
| **Medical Diagnostics**       | Assists in diagnosing diseases, such as identifying issues in X-rays.         |
| **Self-Driving Cars**         | Facilitates autonomous navigation by learning driving behaviors.              |

## Machine Learning vs. Explicit Programming
Unlike explicitly programmed tasks like finding the shortest route (e.g., GPS), machine learning excels where rules are hard to define. This includes:
- Web search rankings.
- Image recognition.
- Fraud detection.
