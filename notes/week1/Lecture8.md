# Lecture 8: Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks in Machine Learning

In the previous lectures, we discussed supervised and unsupervised learning, along with examples of both. This lecture introduces you to the primary tool used by machine learning and data science practitioners: Jupyter Notebooks. By the end of this session, you will understand the basics of Jupyter Notebooks and their role in implementing machine learning concepts.

## Overview of Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks are widely used by machine learning and data science professionals to code, experiment, and test various ideas. They provide an interactive environment where you can write and execute code directly within your web browser.

The Jupyter Notebook environment you will use in this course is identical to what developers at major companies and organizations use. This means you will gain hands-on experience with an industry-standard tool, making your learning process more practical and relatable.

## Types of Labs in This Course
This course includes two types of labs designed to enhance your understanding of machine learning concepts and code:

### 1. **Optional Labs**
Optional labs are straightforward and require minimal effort. They are pre-configured, allowing you to focus on running and observing the provided code without needing to write any yourself.

- **Purpose**: Familiarize yourself with machine learning code and how it functions.
- **Execution**: Open the lab, run each code cell line-by-line (from top to bottom), and observe the results.
- **Key Features**: These labs are entirely optional, carry no grading, and are designed to be completed quickly. While optional, completing them will deepen your understanding of the material.

### 2. **Practice Labs**
Starting next week, you will encounter practice labs where you will write machine learning code yourself. These labs will help you develop coding skills and a more profound grasp of machine learning algorithms.

For now, focus on completing the optional labs to familiarize yourself with the environment.

## Navigating a Jupyter Notebook
When you open a Jupyter Notebook, you will notice two types of blocks (also called "cells"):

### 1. **Markdown Cells**
- **Description**: These contain text used to describe the code and its functionality. Markdown cells support formatted text, which you can edit if needed.
- **How to Execute**: Select the cell and press `Shift + Enter` to render it into formatted text.

### 2. **Code Cells**
- **Description**: These contain Python code. You can run the code to see its output or modify it to observe different behaviors.
- **How to Execute**: Select the cell and press `Shift + Enter` to execute the code.

## How to Use Optional Labs
1. Open the lab and scroll through the notebook.
2. Identify the Markdown and code cells.
3. Read through the code in the cells and try to predict its output.
4. Execute the code by pressing `Shift + Enter` and observe the results.
5. If you feel curious, modify the code and re-run it to see how the output changes.

The optional labs include common Python code snippets to help you become more comfortable with Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. This hands-on experience is invaluable for learning how machine learning code works.

## Benefits of Jupyter Notebooks
- Interactive coding and visualization.
- Easy-to-edit cells for experimentation.
- Industry-standard environment for real-world applications.

## Next Steps
After completing the optional lab, we will move on to a supervised learning problem and implement our first supervised learning algorithm. This will build on your understanding of supervised learning and give you practical experience with machine learning algorithms.
