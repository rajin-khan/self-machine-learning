# Lecture 16: Bringing It All Together: Gradient Descent with Linear Regression

This lecture combines the linear regression model, squared error cost function, and gradient descent algorithm to train the model and fit a straight line to the training data.

#### **Key Components**

1. **Linear Regression Model**:  
   \( f_{w,b}(x) = w \cdot x + b \)  
   The model predicts the output by using parameters \( w \) (slope) and \( b \) (intercept).

2. **Squared Error Cost Function**:  
   \( J(w, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)^2 \)  
   Measures how well the line fits the training data. The goal is to minimize this cost function.

3. **Gradient Descent Algorithm**:  
   Updates parameters \( w \) and \( b \) iteratively to reduce \( J(w, b) \). The update rules are:  
   \[
   w := w - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial w}
   \]
   \[
   b := b - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial b}
   \]

#### **Derivatives of the Cost Function**

The derivatives are derived using calculus:

1. **With Respect to \( w \)**:  
   \[
   \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right) \cdot x^{(i)}
   \]

2. **With Respect to \( b \)**:  
   \[
   \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)
   \]

These formulas are derived by applying the rules of calculus to the squared error cost function. The factor of \( \frac{1}{2} \) in the cost function simplifies the derivatives by canceling out the 2 from differentiation.

#### **Gradient Descent Algorithm for Linear Regression**

The process involves updating \( w \) and \( b \) simultaneously using the derived gradients:

- **Update Rules**:
  \[
  w := w - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right) \cdot x^{(i)}
  \]
  \[
  b := b - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)
  \]

- **Simultaneous Updates**:  
  \( w \) and \( b \) must be updated together at each step of gradient descent.

#### **Key Insights**

1. **Convergence to Global Minimum**:
   - The squared error cost function for linear regression is **convex** (bowl-shaped). 
   - Convex functions have a single global minimum, ensuring that gradient descent always converges to the optimal parameters \( w \) and \( b \), provided the learning rate \( \alpha \) is chosen appropriately.

2. **Impact of Initialization**:
   - Unlike functions with multiple local minima, the convex nature of the cost function ensures that the choice of initial values for \( w \) and \( b \) does not affect reaching the global minimum.

---

#### **Convex Functions and Gradient Descent**

- **Convexity**: A convex function has no local minima other than the global minimum.  
- For linear regression, the cost function's convexity guarantees that gradient descent, with a properly chosen learning rate, will always minimize the cost function.
